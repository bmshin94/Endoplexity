 * concern. Measured 2026-08-12 and false in both halves: cursor's tools are
 * deferred too, and it reaches them with `getMcpTools` in `mode: "single_tool"`
 * — one schema per call, each in a turn of its own, immediately before the first
 * use of that tool. On a nine-turn Hacker News run, FOUR of the nine turns
 * bought nothing but a schema (navigate, click, tabs, snapshot in that order),
 * and every turn re-sends the ones before it.
 *
 * That is the same defect P11a found on the claude side, so it gets the same
 * correction, phrased for cursor's own tool rather than ToolSearch's `select:`.
 * The names come from PRELOAD, which is the one list already pinned against
 * mcp.ts's registerTool calls — adding a tool must not leave this stale twice.
 *
 * NOT yet verified against a live run: the panel dropped before the after-number
 * could be taken, and cursor's bulk-fetch affordance is server-side, so whether
 * `getMcpTools` will take them all at once is the model's call, not ours. The
 * names alone are worth the ~30 tokens — knowing what exists is half of it.
