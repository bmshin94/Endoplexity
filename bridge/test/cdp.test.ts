// ONCE before a dynamic import — a top-level `import` would hoist above the stub,
// and a second stub would never be wired up, because the listeners are only
// registered on the first import.
//
// Scope: dead-OOPIF reaping, and which caller is allowed to OPEN a tab.
// Everything else in cdp.js is verified live by `endo.selftest()`, which drives
// a real Chrome; a stub deep enough to test clicking would only be testing the
