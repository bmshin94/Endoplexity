// default is what can be acted on — every one of those carries its own label, so
// a page of links reads fine without a word of body text. Prose comes back with
// `full`, for tasks that are reading the page rather than driving it.

// Roles worth a ref. Chrome reports computed ARIA roles, so <input> and
// <textarea> both land on "textbox" and <input type=file> on "button".
