 * The conversation view.

 * What this replaces: one <pre> that every event was appended to as a
 * timestamped line — prose, tool calls with their raw JSON args, cost, errors,
 * all in the same monospace stream. A markdown table arrived as literal pipes
 * because the log was textContent. The verdict on that was fair: "it doesn't
 * look like an assistant, just looks like gibberish."
 *
 * The shape here: the answer is the content, and everything else is evidence.
 * Evidence is available, not loud — one grey sentence per tool call, folded,
 * behind an indent rail, at 11.5px. Open a row and the args and result are
 * there in full.
 *
 * Same rule as md.js and for the same reason: this carries page content from
 * arbitrary sites, so nothing here ever touches innerHTML.
