// Two things here are load-bearing and were built first on purpose:

//     cross-origin iframes, which are separate renderer targets. The main
//     frame's AX tree contains nothing for them, so every OOPIF gets its own
//     CDP session and its own slice of the snapshot, with refs namespaced per
//     frame (@f1e7). Retrofitting this would mean rewriting the ref system.
//  2. Refs die. Every snapshot mints a new generation; navigation bumps it.
//     Acting on an old ref fails loudly instead of clicking whatever inherited
//     that backend node id — the single most common failure mode in every
//     agentic-browser clone surveyed.
//
// Requires Chrome 125+, where chrome.debugger.sendCommand accepts a sessionId.
